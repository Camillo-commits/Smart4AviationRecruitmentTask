Importing Cargo is very simillar to importing Baggage.
Flight record connected to the baggage needs to be already in the database in order to perform correct import.
Import URL:

 - http://localhost:8080/cargo/x

The The "x" letter stands for the flight id. So if data is connected with flight with id 1 use:
"http://localhost:8080/cargo/1" url.

In the body of the request send a list of cargo entities for desired flight.

Example:

[
    {
        "id": 0,
        "weight": 553,
        "weightUnit": "lb",
        "pieces": 132
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "weight": 296,
        "weightUnit": "lb",
        "pieces": 935
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "weight": 771,
        "weightUnit": "kg",
        "pieces": 198
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "weight": 344,
        "weightUnit": "lb",
        "pieces": 493
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "weight": 512,
        "weightUnit": "kg",
        "pieces": 744
    }
]

DISCLAIMER:
"id" visible in the example is the local id for each entity. 
Because cargo/baggage for each flight had id's counting from 0 another id that is autogenerated is used as primary key.
